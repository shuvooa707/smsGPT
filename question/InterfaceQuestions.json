[{"number":0,"question":"How can you implement multiple interfaces in a class in Java?","answer":"\n\nIn Java, a class can implement multiple interfaces by separating them with commas in the class declaration after the keyword \"implements\". \n\nFor example, suppose we have two interfaces: Shape and Drawable. We can implement both of them in a class called Circle:\n\n```\ninterface Shape {\n    public double area();\n}\n\ninterface Drawable {\n    public void draw();\n}\n\nclass Circle implements Shape, Drawable {\n    private double radius;\n\n    public Circle(double radius) {\n        this.radius = radius;\n    }\n\n    public double area() {\n        return Math.PI * Math.pow(radius, 2);\n    }\n\n    public void draw() {\n        // implementation of drawing logic for Circle\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the above code, the Circle class implements the Shape and Drawable interfaces. It provides the required implementation details for both of the interface methods area() and draw(). \n\nNote that if two interfaces contain a method with the same signature, then the implementation only needs to be provided once in the implementing class."},{"number":1,"question":"Can an interface have instance variables in Java?","answer":"\n\nNo, an interface cannot have instance variables in Java. Interface can have only constants (public static final variables) that must be initialized at the time of declaration.\n\nExample:\n\n```java\ninterface ExampleInterface {\n  // interface variables should only be public, static and final\n  public static final int MAX_COUNT = 100;\n  // this will throw an error: \"Illegal modifier for interface field MAX_COUNT; only public, static & final are permitted\"\n  private int count = 0;\n}\n```"},{"number":2,"question":"Can we create a private interface in Java?","answer":"\n\nYes, we can create a private interface in Java. A private interface can be used for internal implementation purposes within a class and cannot be accessed from outside the class. \n\nHere's an example to create a private interface in Java:\n\n```\npublic class MyClass {\n  \n  private interface MyPrivateInterface {\n    void myPrivateMethod();\n  }\n  \n  public void myPublicMethod() {\n    // implementation\n  }\n  \n  private void myPrivateMethod() {\n    // implementation\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we have declared a private interface `MyPrivateInterface` inside the `MyClass` class. This interface only has one method `myPrivateMethod()` which can only be accessed within the `MyClass` class. We have also declared a public method `myPublicMethod()` and a private method `myPrivateMethod()`. These methods can be accessed within the `MyClass` class.\n\nBy creating a private interface, we can use it as a helper interface for the implementation of public methods within the class. It is a good practice to keep implementation details hidden from users of the class."},{"number":3,"question":"Can an interface extend another interface in Java?","answer":"\n\nYes, an interface can extend another interface in Java by using the \"extends\" keyword.\n\nHere is an example code that demonstrates the same:\n\n```java\ninterface Animal {\n   public void eat();\n   public void sleep();\n}\n\ninterface Dog extends Animal {\n   public void bark();\n}\n\nclass Labrador implements Dog {\n   public void bark() {\n      System.out.println(\"Labrador barks\");\n   }\n   public void eat() {\n      System.out.println(\"Labrador eats\");\n   }\n   public void sleep() {\n      System.out.println(\"Labrador sleeps\");\n   }\n}\n\nclass Main {\n   public static void main(String[] args) {\n      Labrador l = new Labrador();\n      l.bark();\n      l.eat();\n      l.sleep();\n   }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, we have defined two interfaces, \"Animal\" and \"Dog\". Interface \"Dog\" extends \"Animal\" interface. Then, we have implemented the \"Dog\" interface in the \"Labrador\" class. Finally, we have created an object of the \"Labrador\" class and called its methods.\n\nSo, we can see how we have extended an interface in Java by using the \"extends\" keyword to inherit the methods of one interface into another interface."},{"number":4,"question":"Can an abstract class implement an interface in Java?","answer":"\n\nYes, an abstract class can implement an interface in Java. Here's an example code:\n\n```\npublic interface MyInterface {\n   void sayHello();\n}\n\npublic abstract class MyAbstractClass implements MyInterface {\n   public void sayHello() {\n      System.out.println(\"Hello from abstract class.\");\n   }\n   public abstract void sayGoodbye();\n}\n\npublic class MyConcreteClass extends MyAbstractClass {\n   public void sayGoodbye() {\n      System.out.println(\"Goodbye from concrete class.\");\n   }\n}\n\npublic class Main {\n   public static void main(String[] args) {\n      MyConcreteClass obj = new MyConcreteClass();\n      obj.sayHello();\n      obj.sayGoodbye();\n   }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, `MyInterface` defines the method `sayHello()`. `MyAbstractClass` is an abstract class that implements `MyInterface` and overrides the `sayHello()` method. It also declares an abstract method `sayGoodbye()`. `MyConcreteClass` extends `MyAbstractClass` and provides implementation for the `sayGoodbye()` method. Finally, in the `main` method, we create an object of `MyConcreteClass` and call both the `sayHello()` and `sayGoodbye()` methods. The output of this program would be:\n\n```\nHello from abstract class.\nGoodbye from concrete class.\n```"},{"number":5,"question":"Can a class implement two interfaces having a method with the same
